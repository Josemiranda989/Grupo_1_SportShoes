    <h2 style="font-weight:bold;">Orders, returns, and exchanges</h2>
    <p>
      We're taking every step to process orders, returns and exchanges as quickly as possible, but we want to protect all team members working in our distribution centers and facilities during this time. Our shipping partners are also taking steps to protect their employees.
      They are working extremely hard to minimize delays, but this has led to longer shipping, processing and delivery times.
      While there will be shipping delays, we are doing our best to get you your order as soon as we can. When calling our customer service please note that we are experiencing unprecedented volume and you should expect longer wait and response time when contacting us by phone, email or chat.  
      To obtain the status on your recent order, please visit the "Order Status" page.
      We ask that you please wait for your shipping notification before contacting us via phone, email or chat for the status of your order.  We are working hard to process all orders in a timely manner and cancellations cannot be guaranteed.
