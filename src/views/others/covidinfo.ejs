      <h2 style="font-weight: bold">Orders, returns, and exchanges</h2>
      <p>
        We're taking every step to process orders, returns and exchanges as
        quickly as possible, but we want to protect all team members working in
        our distribution centers and facilities during this time. Our shipping
        partners are also taking steps to protect their employees. They are
        working extremely hard to minimize delays, but this has led to longer
        shipping, processing and delivery times. While there will be shipping
        delays, we are doing our best to get you your order as soon as we can.
        When calling our customer service please note that we are experiencing
        unprecedented volume and you should expect longer wait and response time
        when contacting us by phone, email or chat. To obtain the status on your
        recent order, please visit the "Order Status" page. We ask that you
        please wait for your shipping notification before contacting us via
        phone, email or chat for the status of your order. We are working hard
        to process all orders in a timely manner and cancellations cannot be
        guaranteed. For reliable and timely COVID-19 information, we recommend
